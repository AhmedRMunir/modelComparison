	Abstract = {Experiences, whether they be learning in a classroom, a stressful event, or ingestion of a psychoactive substance, impact the brain by modifying the activity and organization of specific neural circuitry. A major mechanism by which the neural activity generated by an experience modifies brain function is via modifications of synaptic transmission; that is, synaptic plasticity. Here, we review current understanding of the mechanisms of the major forms of synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. We also provide examples of the possible developmental and behavioral functions of synaptic plasticity and how maladaptive synaptic plasticity may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders.},

    abstract = { The computation performed by a neuron can be formulated as a combination of dimensional reduction in stimulus space and the nonlinearity inherent in a spiking output. White noise stimulus and reverse correlation (the spike-triggered average and spike-triggered covariance) are often used in experimental neuroscience to âaskâ neurons which dimensions in stimulus space they are sensitive to and to characterize the nonlinearity of the response. In this article, we apply reverse correlation to the simplest model neuron with temporal dynamicsâthe leaky integrate-andfire modelâand find that for even this simple case, standard techniques do not recover the known neural computation. To overcome this, we develop novel reverse-correlation techniques by selectively analyzing only âisolatedâ spikes and taking explicit account of the extended silences that precede these isolated spikes. We discuss the implications of our methods to the characterization of neural adaptation. Although these methods are developed in the context of the leaky integrate-and-fire model, our findings are relevant for the analysis of spike trains from real neurons. }
